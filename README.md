# MSDS686-Seedlings-Classification-CNN
This paper decribes the process for developing and comparing convolutional neural networks (CNN) in a classification problem for a deep learning course. The data used in this project is the "Plant Seedling Data" from a current Kaggle competition. The goal of the classification problem is to predict the species of plant seedling based on images.

The process for this project includes several components. The plant seedling training and testing data are obtained from the Kaggle website and loaded in Colab for processing. The Kaggle images are "labeled" by placement of each image in a folder with the designated label. The images were retrieved from these folders, placed into an array with the name of the folder set as the "label." Once the images are obtained, the training data is separated into images and labels. The training data is then processed as input for CNN in Keras. Six CNN models are tested and compared to identify the most accurate model to use for the Kaggle submission. Most of the code for this project was modified from NikKonst (2018) which along with the Chollet (2018) textbook served as a guide for the entire process.

The project was performed on Colab's tensorflow deep learning software running on Google's Tensor Processing Unit.
